#getting text in image 

I have done following processes:

step 1:
        for reading the image and preprocessing using opencv 

step 2:
	after preprocessing extract the data

step 3: 
        split across : delimiter

step 4: 
        some data is not in  line so get all data using within word 

step 5:
        make a dictionary and save into the dataframe and save into csv
